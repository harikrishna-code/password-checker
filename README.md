# Password Strength Checker (Beginner Python Project)

A simple Python script that checks the strength of a password using 5 basic rules:
- Minimum length of 8 characters
- At least one digit
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one special character

The script gives your password a **score out of 5** and labels it from **Very Weak** to **Very Strong**.

---

## How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Run the program using terminal:

```bash
python3 password_checker.py
```


Then enter any password when prompted 
You'll get a score and feedback like this

```
Too short (minimum 8 characters)
No special symbol (!@#$...)
Password Score: 3/5 Moderate Password
```
  
  > *The above is an example result.*
  
### Why I Built This
  
  This is my first ever Python project, and my first step into cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I built this on:
  An old Thinkpad T410 with KALI OS installed
  
  I learned:

    Python basics
    
    Regular expressions
    
    Using Geany as a lightweight code editor
    
    Git & GitHub
    
    How to push code using a Personal Access Token (PAT)
